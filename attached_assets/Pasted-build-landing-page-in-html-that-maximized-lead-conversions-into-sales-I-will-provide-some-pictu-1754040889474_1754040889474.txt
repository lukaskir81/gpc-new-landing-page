It really depends on your goals. All of our online packages are designed to help you achieve the results you desire in the shortest time possible. If we are talking about body composition (body fat reduction for example), results can be seen in as little as a month. However, if we are talking about improvements in strength, speed, or power, a more realistic timeframe is three months (which is why this is our minimum sign-up term). This is also how long most of our clients take to achieve their goals. How does on line coaching work? Once you purchase our online training package, we will create your online account and, within 24 hours, you will receive an email inviting you to download our training app from the App Store/Play Store to your smartphone/tablet. After you register your login information, you will receive an online consultation form ‚Äì it is important to fill out the form accurately and provide as much information as possible to allow us to create the best possible programme for you. There is also the option for a over the phone/zoom/ skype consultation to be scheduled if you prefer a more face-to-face meeting. When we receive your completed form, you will be assigned to a coach who will get started immediately on designing your tailored training programme. This usually takes between 24-48 hours and, as soon as they are completed, you will have full access to them through your app account and you can get started right away! You will also be given nutritional, supplement and training guides that will help you fully understand your programme and how to successfully achieve your goals. What if I want to refund /cancel my membership? At GPC, we are passionate about helping our clients to achieve their goals and we are dedicated in doing this! Therefore, we have a strict no refund policy. We believe that offering a refund policy is the same as giving people an opportunity to quit, and that is not the way to go about it. Our online coaching is set up using a pay monthly subscription and can be canceled at any time (after initial 3 months period). If you choose to cancel your subscription, your account simply becomes deactivated after 30 days of the last payment. Can I do your on-line coaching from anywhere? Is there a free trial period? Absolutely! One of the great things about GPC online training is that you can effectively take the training anywhere you want - in your home, in a hotel or in your local gym For our programmes, we recommend a minimum of a basic weights bench, barbell and dumbbell weight set, exercise band. GPC does not provide a free trial period due to the custom nature of each program and client needs. Frankly, a free trial erodes the value of the program and the expertise and experience of the coaching team. What if I have an injury? Depending on the type of injury and the stage of healing, We can create programs that limit or avoid stress to the affected site. We can also develop corrective exercise strategies to improve joint stabilization, connective tissue strength and flexibility. Can I buy now and start the programme later? The timing isn‚Äôt right right now. Yes you can. You can purchase your plan and start with it whenever you think the time is right. What guarantees do I have of getting results I want ? Ultimately, the guarantee of getting the results you desire is down to you and how committed you are to getting them. You must work hard, commit to it and give it the best shot . That, combined with proper amount rest and recovery will drive you to success, get and keep you where you want to be. The road to success is never a straight one, if it was everyone would be successful.
